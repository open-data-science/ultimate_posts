# ODS #wheretostart recommendations

This article collects public knowledge on how to start learning field commonly addressed as Data Science. We are adressing what is called DS, what spheres and disciplined are covered by it and suggest recipes for stepping on path of getting familiar with this field.

Data Science is a term describing everything related to processing, storing and mining any information. This includes different disciplines, cources and spheres of our life. General undestanding (helicopter overview) can be derived from reading Google's brilliant [web comic](https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1/) (~5 min) and reading great Vas3k's post [Machine Learning for Everyone](https://vas3k.com/blog/machine_learning/) (~15 min).

There is now way to be taught to be data scientist, but you can learn how to become one yourself. There is no right way, but there is a way, which was adopted by a number of data scientists and it lies with online courses (MOOC). With this article we aim at anwering those common questions:

1. Where to start with data science?
2. How to become a data scientist?

We are looking up at the awesome resource [Teach Yourself CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com) and aim at providing useful and actionable insights on how to learn skills and get knowledge to get onto data-driven way. However if you don't like our guide there are some alternatives included into the appendix.

### Buzzwords disclaimer

We want to provide most inclusive and open information, therefore we do not explicitly distinquish skills between what one would name different job specialisations: ML Engineers, Data Engineers, Deep Learning specialists, Data Analytics etc.

## TL;DR:

We assume that you have at least some background with programming, if not, you can address the aforementioned [Teach Yourself CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com) to learn basics of [programming](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#programming) and [algorithms](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#algorithms).

Then you can get at least an overview of these topics, ideally studying suggested courses and/or watching videos. If you need any learning path, you can address the [suggested](learning_path_1.md) by our fellow community member or any other alternative articles at the end of the article.
